# PyTorch

This is a simple tutorial to provide an understanding of what is PyTorch and what it is useful for.

## Introduction

PyTorch is defined as an open source machine learning library for Python. It is initially developed by Facebook artificial-intelligence research group, and Uberâ€™s Pyro software for probabilistic programming which is built on it.

PyTorch was originally developed by Hugh Perkins as a Python wrapper based on Torch framework. PyTorch is very "pythonic", meaning it will feel more natural to use if you are already familiar with Python programming.

PyTorch redesigns and implements Torch in Python while sharing the same core C libraries for the backend code. PyTorch developers tuned this back-end code to run Python efficiently. They also kept the GPU based hardware acceleration as well as the extensibility features that made Lua-based Torch.
